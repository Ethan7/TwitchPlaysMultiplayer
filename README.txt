First run the prerequisite library installer, unless you haven't installed python, in which case do that first.

Then edit main.py, by adding your username and oauth key from twitch in the spaces on lines 228 and 229.

Then run the main.py code and stream away, every user will get a physics player.

Press space to move all physics player's to the center of the screen.

Hold right click, drag, and release to create floating platforms.

Left click and drag physics players to move them to a desired location or drag an objective marker around

Middle click to remove floating platforms

If players reach the objective marker it resets the field and gives that player their name on the background

Be sure to tell your twitch chat to use:
"input:left" to move their player left.
"input:right" to move their player right.
"input:jump" to jump
